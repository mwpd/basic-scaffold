/**
 * The dependency injector should be the only piece of code doing actual
 * instantiations, with the following exceptions:
 *  - Factories can instantiate directly.
 *  - Value objects should be instantiated directly where they are being used.
 *
 * Through technical features like "binding" interfaces to classes or
 * "auto-wiring" to resolve all dependency of a class to be instantiated
 * automatically, the dependency injector allows for the largest part of the
 * code to adhere to the "Code against Interfaces, not Implementations"
 * principle.
 *
 * Finally, the dependency injector should be the only one to decide what
 * objects to "share" (always handing out the same instance) or not to share
 * (always returning a fresh new instance on each subsequent call). This
 * effectively gets rid of the dreaded Singletons.
